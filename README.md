The Frug Life
=============================

A <a href="www.kodi.tv">KODI</a> / XBMC / Firestick audio addon for <a href="https://www.thefruglife.com/">The Frug life</a> - a podcast on Frugal living and business. There are alot of business podcasts and a lot of frugal living podcasts, why does the world need another one? Well, I am tired of the same interview format podcast many of these programs take. So instead, I am created a structured podcast where I can share my thoughts about Frugal living, the economy, and business.<br>
